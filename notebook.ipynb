      "Great choice! Here is a simple recipe for Bibimbap, a popular Korean dish:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 2 cups cooked white rice\n",
      "- 1 carrot, julienned\n",
      "- 1 zucchini, julienned\n",
      "- 1 cup bean sprouts\n",
      "- 1 cup spinach\n",
      "- 4 shiitake mushrooms, sliced\n",
      "- 1/2 pound beef (such as ribeye or sirloin), thinly sliced\n",
      "- 4 eggs\n",
      "- 4 tablespoons gochujang (Korean red chili paste)\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons soy sauce\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons sesame oil\n",
      "- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n",
      "- Salt and pepper to taste\n",
      "- Sesame seeds for garnish\n",
      "- Vegetable oil for cooking\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Marinate the beef: In a bowl, mix the beef with soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, salt, and pepper. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.\n",
      "2. Prepare the vegetables: Blanch the bean sprouts and spinach in boiling water for 1-2 minutes, then rinse with cold water and squeeze out excess water. Saut√© the carrots, zucchini, and mushrooms in a pan with a little vegetable oil until tender.\n",
      "3. Cook the beef: In the same pan, cook the marinated beef over high heat until browned and cooked through.\n",
      "4. Fry the eggs: In a separate pan, fry the eggs sunny-side up or over easy.\n",
      "5. Assemble the Bibimbap: Divide the cooked rice among four bowls. Arrange the cooked vegetables, beef, and fried eggs on top of the rice. Add a dollop of gochujang on the side.\n",

      "\n",
      "- Tofu: Use firm tofu and cut it into thin slices or cubes. To give it flavor similar to the marinated beef, you can marinate the tofu in a mixture of soy sauce, sesame oil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper for at least 30 minutes before cooking. Then, pan-fry or bake the tofu until it is browned and slightly crispy.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Tempeh: Cut the tempeh into thin slices or cubes.

After marinating, pan-fry or bake the tempeh until it is golden brown and crispy on the outside.\n",
